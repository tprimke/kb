# jQueryMobile

## Why jQueryMobile?

Using jQM, you can build simple and nice-looking user's interfaces in a short amount of time.

(The amount of time gets even shorter, when you'll learn how to use ReactJS.)

jQM is tested on **many** mobile devices and OSes. It's a great effort from the community, that we should make some use of.

jQM is stable and leading technology, which won't suddenly disappear.

## Pages

The first thing you should learn about, is how to create [pages](http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/pages/). You should study both single and multiple page documents.

Then, you can learn everything else, just as you need it.

Try to "sketch" some applications, using jQM, and check, whether your UI is usable.
