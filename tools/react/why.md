# Why React?

I think it's quite save to assume, that everyone has played with blocks. A single block is nothing special, you cannot do many things with it. The only thing you can do, is to connect it with other blocks. And by connecting blocks together, you can build amazing things.

Now think about a single block. As I have said, it's nothing special. More precisely, it's rather simple. But that's good, since it allows us to create and then modify many various blocks, without getting lost. And once we have our blocks, and we know how to connect them in order to build something bigger, more complex, and more interesting, we are able to build wonderful things.

That's why I have chosen React. React allows me to build simple blocks, which I can control. React also gives me a very simple way to compose blocks using other blocks ("connecting blocks") in order to build more sophisticated things. Once I understood the way the connected blocks cooperate, I was able to use React to build UIs with almost no problems.

React is much simpler than, eg. Angular (which is one of React's main competitors). From my own experience I can say, that React is much easier to learn, although it might require a little more work at the beginning.
