# Cloning a project

Simply clone the git repository:

    $ git clone repo_url

ans then run the command:

    $ npm install

in order to install all the dependencies.

In general, the `npm install` command should be run every time the repository has been pulled, since it's possible, that a new development dependencies have been introduced.
